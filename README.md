# IMAGE CLASSIFIERS (Understanding Computer Vision)

Find easy to learn solutions to various image processing mechanisms using TensorFlow, Keras and Python.
## Getting Started

You should have the basic understanding of how a CNN or image processing works.<br />
[Udemy](https://udemy.com) has rich set of courses available on Machine Learning.   

### Prerequisites

Python3, Pycharm or repl.it for testing your built code.

### Installing Pycharm and Python 3

You can get Pycharm community version from [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).<br />
Command to install Python3 in Linux below:
 
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
```

### Installing TensorFlow and Keras

Refer the installation process of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) here.<br />
PIP to install CPU-version of TensorFlow:
 
```
sudo pip install tensorflow
```

PIP to install GPU-version of TensorFlow:
 
```
sudo pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

PIP to install [Keras](https://keras.io/):
 
```
sudo pip install keras
```
